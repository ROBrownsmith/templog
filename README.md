# templog
This is Python code for a fridge temperature logger that would run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W to send sensed data to a remote server using HTTP. The server should collect the data from clients over the day and store the maximum and minimum cenitgrade temperature recorded by each client, to show to a logged in user.
